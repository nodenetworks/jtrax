JTrax is a Joomla! 5 component that allows customer to track service status of repair or similar service on the website.
In the backend operator adds a status to a code that is issued to the customer. As the work progressing, operator can add new statuses together with the date.
Component allows to define preconfigured list of statuses to be selected from the drop-down menu.
Additionaly to each status it is possible to add Details (50 chars) and Notes (text field).
Presence of those fields can be disabled in the frontend so they can also be used as a notebook for backend operator.

Customer enters code on the frontend and can review current status of repair.

Component started as a fork of another one originally created as JTracking by Giovanni Mansillo in 2010.
It has been modified by Micha≈Ç Ostrykiewicz to be compatible with Joomla! 5 and new features were added.
